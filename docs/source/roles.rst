Roles
=======

The **IBM Power Systems HMC collection** contains roles that can be used in a playbook
to automate tasks on HMC. Ansible executes each tasks on the target node and
returns the result back to the controller. While different roles perform
different tasks, their interfaces and responses follow similar patterns.

Role reference
----------------

Reference material for each role contains documentation on the accepted
parameters and their expected values.
